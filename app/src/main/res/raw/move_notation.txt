    Distance (numbers, n)
        1 – a distance of one (i.e. to adjacent square)
        2 – a distance of two
        n – any distance in the given direction
        x – only in pairs (x,x): any distance in the given direction equal to its twin or zero (e.g. (0,0),(1,1),(-1,-1),(1,-1),(-1,1),...,(0,1),(1,0)
    Direction (punctuation, X)
        * – orthogonally or diagonally (all eight possible directions)
        + – orthogonally (four possible directions)
        > – orthogonally forwards
        < – orthogonally backwards
        <> – orthogonally forwards and backwards
        = – orthogonally sideways (used here instead of Parlett's divide symbol.)
        >= – orthogonally forwards or sideways
        <= – orthogonally backwards or sideways
        X – diagonally (four possible directions)
        X> – diagonally forwards
        X< – diagonally backwards
    Grouping
        / – two orthogonal moves separated by a slash denote a hippogonal move (i.e. jumps like a knight)
        & – repeated movement in the same direction, such as for hippogonal riders (i.e. the nightrider)
        . – then, (i.e. an aanca is 1X.n+; one step diagonally and then any distance orthogonally outwards)

Additions to Parlett's

The following can be added to Parlett's to make it more complete:[citation needed]

    Conditions under which the move may occur (lowercase alphanumeric, except n)
        (default) – May occur at any point in the game
        i – May only be made on the initial move (e.g. pawn's 2 moves forward)
        c – May only be made on a capture (e.g. pawn's diagonal capture)
        o – May not be used for a capture (e.g. pawn's forward move)
    Move type
        (default) – Captures by landing on the piece; blocked by intermediate pieces
        ~ – Leaper (leaps)
        ^ – Locust (captures by leaping; implies leaper)
        g – moves by leaping over piece to an empty square (if leaped over enemy => capture)
    Grouping (punctuation)
        , (comma) – separates move options; only one of the comma-delimited options may be chosen per move
        () – grouping operator; see nightrider
        - – range operator

The format (not including grouping) is: <conditions> <move type> <distance> <direction> <other>

On this basis, the traditional chess moves (excluding castling and en passant capture) are:

    King: 1*
    Queen: n*
    Bishop: nX
    Rook: n+
    Pawn: o1>, c1X>, oi2>
    Knight: ~1/2
